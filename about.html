			<p>Shakma is a thrash metal band hailing from Haugesund on the west coast of Norway. Formed in 2014 the band set out to combine the sound of acts like Slayer, Whiplash, Possessed, Kreator and Sodom with the bands interest in obscure horror movies; creating the perfect mixture of horror themed thrash metal.</p>
			<p>The band recorded its 4 track demo "Night of Torment" during september of 2016. The demo was released on 23 homemade tapes and handed out to a lucky few during the first Heavy Nights Festival in Haugesund in 2016. Shortly after that the band was contacted by Duplicate Records and was offered a record deal.</p>
			<p>2018 saw the release of Shakma's debut album "House of Possession". It was released on vinyl (100x limited - 200x black) and CD (300x). Following its release the band has been booked to festivals like Heavy Nights, Beyond the Gates, Southern Discomfort, Karm√∏ygeddon and Inferno.</p>
			<p>This is just the beginning...we have arrived!</p>
